       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>Since young, I've been curious about how the world works. A big part of why I love maths is its power to explain natural phenomena, via abstraction and reasoning. It also serves as a universal language, and a rich source of perspective ("intuition"). </p>
       <p>I enjoy learning and teaching maths. I don't mind being lost in the unknown; on the other hand, I find it extremely rewarding when pieces fall into place, a new perspective unfolds, or an idea is brought to life. I strive to understand and communicate maths intuition. </p>
       <p>I am currently interested in geometry: the study of shapes. In particular, (co)homology captures local-global properties, which have applications in enumeration and classification. Certain natural objects (such as the moduli space of curves) have rich geometry that is still yet to be fully understood. I am also vaguely interested in the flavour of maths that appears in theoretical physics.</p>
       <p>Outside of academics, I play (recreational) basketball and dabble in frisbee, squash, badminton, and bouldering. I watch anime. I play hanabi, poker, and casual board games. I spend time with family and friends. I cover pop songs on the piano. I cook every so often. I am passively curious about other aspects of the world: economics, politics, history, philosophy, and the human condition. I try to write. </p>
